            <h3>Intro</h3>

                <p>Atlanta, GA – Hurricane Helene made landfall in Georgia early Monday morning, bringing with it torrential rains, powerful winds, and widespread destruction.

                <h3>Impact and Damage</h3>

                <p>The coastal cities of Savannah and Brunswick bore the brunt of Helene’s fury. Reports indicate extensive flooding, with some areas receiving over 15 inches of rain within a few hours. The storm surge, combined with high tides, inundated low-lying neighborhoods, leaving many residents stranded and in need of rescue. Power outages have been reported across the state, affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Emergency services are working tirelessly to restore electricity and provide aid to those affected. The Georgia Department of Transportation has closed several major highways due to fallen trees and debris, complicating rescue and relief efforts.</p>
                
                <h3>Community Response</h3>

                <p>Despite the devastation, communities across Georgia have shown remarkable resilience and solidarity. Local shelters have opened their doors to those displaced by the storm, offering food, water, and medical assistance. Volunteers from neighboring states have also arrived to lend a hand in the recovery efforts. Governor Brian Kemp has declared a state of emergency and urged residents to remain indoors and heed the warnings of local authorities. “Our priority is the safety and well-being of our citizens. We are working around the clock to ensure that help reaches those in need as quickly as possible,” Kemp stated in a press conference.</p>
                <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>

                <p>Meteorologists predict that Hurricane Helene will continue to move inland, weakening as it progresses. However, the threat of heavy rainfall and flash flooding remains high.

In the face of adversity, the community’s strength and unity will undoubtedly play a crucial role in rebuilding and moving forward.</p>
